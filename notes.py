	<p>
		The blocks here are generally more compact and closer to each other, as compared to the regular HDB flats.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each 12-storey flat has four to six units per floor and every flat is served by two lifts. This is obviously much denser lift coverage as compared to the HDB flats.
	</p>
	<p>
		The corridors receive little natural light and can be very dark in the afternoons and evenings, before the artificial lights kick in.
	</p>
	<p>
		Interestingly, Parc Lumiere has its own Parc Lumiere Residents' Committee (RC). It is unclear if this RC only serves Parc Lumiere residents.

# Tropicana

	<p>
		<b>Tropicana</b> is slightly different from the other condominiums - it is on a 999-year leasehold tenure as compared to the typical 99-year.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is also surprisingly low-density for a condominium, housing 40 two-storey units. Compare this to other condominiums in the area, which house hundreds of units (Sunhaven houses 295 units; Melville Park houses 1232 units).
	</p>

		Security seems to be tight around the dull pink <b>Melville Park</b> and entry could not be obtained.
	</p>
	<p>
		A second-hand account mentions the condominium being popular with foreigners.

		As its name suggests, <b>Savannah Condopark</b> is safari-themed and the residence is filled with black-bronze statues of elephants, giraffes, jaguars, rhinos and all manner of fauna. 
	</p>

		Has a bowling alley and a karaoke room.

# Sunhaven

notes['way/454188459'] = '''
	<p>
		Residence of yours truly, so here is a more detailed case study:
	</p>
	<p>
		A family of five plus one helper staying in a four-bedroom apartment. At the highest density, there was a total of eight people living in the apartment. But this is an anomaly, with most other apartments being occupied by three to five people.
	</p>
	<p>
		The family is about upper-middle class. Both parents are working professionals and their two children have also begun working, after graduating with bachelor's degrees from university recently. They previously resided in a HDB apartment and moved to this condominium about 15 years ago, after the father's (self-employed) electrical engineering business had taken off.
