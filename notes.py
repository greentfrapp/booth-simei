		The blocks here are generally more compact and closer to each other, as compared to the regular HDB flats.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each 12-storey flat has four to six units per floor and every flat is served by two lifts. This is obviously much denser lift coverage as compared to the HDB flats.
	</p>
	<p>
		The corridors receive little natural light and can be very dark in the afternoons and evenings, before the artificial lights kick in.
	</p>
	<p>
		Interestingly, Parc Lumiere has its own Parc Lumiere Residents' Committee (RC). It is unclear if this RC only serves Parc Lumiere residents.

# Sunhaven

notes['way/454188459'] = '''
	<p>
		Residence of yours truly, so here is a more detailed case study:
	</p>
	<p>
		A family of five plus one helper staying in a four-bedroom apartment. At the highest density, there was a total of eight people living in the apartment. But this is an anomaly, with most other apartments being occupied by three to five people.
	</p>
	<p>
		The family is about upper-middle class. Both parents are working professionals and their two children have also begun working, after graduating with bachelor's degrees from university recently. They previously resided in a HDB apartment and moved to this condominium about 15 years ago, after the father's (self-employed) electrical engineering business had taken off.
